## Firmware
DC60's default PCB (non-Bluetooth version, provided by ALF) is powered by QMK and it supports a variety of layouts. 

* Flashing a firmware will require that you have a keyboard firmware .hex file with correct layout information. 
* .hex file can be generated either using a QMK compiler, or an online tool. In this guide, we will be demonstrating with the QMK firmware builder provided by Ruiqi Mao (豆仔). And the website is: http://qmkeyboard.cn/ 
* If you plan to build an ANSI layout, or a standard arrow cluster layout. Please first download the pre-configured [json file](/assets/firmware/dc60.json) (credits to Cary Cai), and upload it to the [QMK firmware builder](http://qmkeyboard.cn/).

If you plan to use ANSI Standard, please
