## Firmware
DC60's default PCB (non-Bluetooth version, provided by ALF) is powered by QMK and it supports a variety of layouts. 

* Flashing a firmware will require that you have a keyboard firmware .hex file with correct layout information. 
* .hex file can be generated either using a QMK compiler, or an online tool. In this guide, we will be demonstrating with the QMK firmware builder provided by Ruiqi Mao (豆仔). And the website is: http://qmkeyboard.cn/ 
* If you plan to build an ANSI layout, or a standard arrow cluster layout. Please first download the pre-configured [json file](/assets/firmware/dc60.json) (credits to Cary Cai), and upload it to the [QMK firmware builder](http://qmkeyboard.cn/).
* After this step, you may click the *KEYMAP* button on the same page, and start configuring your layout. Specifically, you can modify each key on multiple layers. Make sure you assign *MO(1)* to the intended FN key in Layer 0.
* If you plan to build a 2u left-shift version, or even a Minila layout, please instead download this pre-configured [json file](/assets/firmware/dc60_minila.json), and use the same approach explained for the ANSI layout.

Hope you find this guide useful. If you have additional information, please hit me (oldcat) up in the [ALF Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/NHYnp8g).
