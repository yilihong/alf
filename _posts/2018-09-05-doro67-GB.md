Doro67, love at the first sight. 

After a short period of wait and rapidly testing 2 prototypes, we now proudly announce the Groupbuy for Doro67. 80ultraman, designer of Doro67, takes this endeavor really seriously, and everything in this board has been finetuned to his perfection. The making of Doro67 is the best case of practicing keyboard science, as every fine detail has the scientific reasoning behind it.

Since we have released tons of details for the design concepts, prototypes, and incorporation of your feedback and ideas in the [Geekhack Interest Check Page](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=96935.0), we will go directly to the details of this GB, with a few nice photos of the final prototype to share.
