Is building a customized keyboard science or art? Can we design a keyboard that is based on the precision of science for perfect utility, and the good principles of art for ideal aesthetics?

Meet Doro67, a masterpiece 65% customized mechanical keyboard combining science and art of keyboard design. 

After rapidly testing 2 prototypes, we now proudly announce the Groupbuy for Doro67. 80ultraman, designer of Doro67, takes this endeavor to heart, finetuning everything in this board hundreds of times to his standard of perfection. The making of Doro67 is the best case of practicing keyboard science, as every fine detail in the design has a scientific reasoning behind it. For example, the integrated 4mm plate allows for consistent typing feedback; and the low-profile front-end design allows for efforless typing with as well as without a wristrest.

Doro67 has also benefited from the incorporation of your feedback and ideas from you, community members. We have taken suggestions from you seriously, discussing the feasibility, and implementing as they add value to the project. Since we have released tons of details for the design concepts, prototypes, and ealy renders in the [Geekhack Interest Check Page](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=96935.0), here we will go directly to the details of this group buy, with a few nice photos of the final prototype to share with you.
