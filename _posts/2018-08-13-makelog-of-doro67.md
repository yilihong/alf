The concept of Doro67 was conceived by 80Ultraman (Gghi on GH), a reputable designer based in Pittsburg, PA, who also created the SA Composite Keycap Set. The goal of Doro67 was to construct a simple yet functional integrated 65% keyboard, which allows for a ultra stable typing experience. The case shape is inspired by the unity feel of the Rama's M65A, yet distinguishes itself as more integrative. Here are the key features:

Features:

1. 6061 Aluminum Case
2. 4mm Integrated Plate
3. QMK PCB
4. 8 degrees slope
5. USB-C connector
6. 4 rubber feet included
7. designed by 80ultraman (Gghi on GH)
8. Manufactured by ALF
